# Fake news detection app

 Our task was to create a severless web application with meaning!
 
 We decided to create an app to tell you whether your news is fake or true 
 
 All news is based off a dataset we made with over 7000 articles
 
 We used flask to deploy our app, SQL database to store our data and using Azure Data Factory
 we created a pipeline that extracts data from the source SQL database and loads it into a blob
 storage.
 
 This github repistory has all the code for you to create your own!
